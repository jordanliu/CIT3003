Analysis of Algorithms

When housing schemes are built, utility companies will need to connect their utilities to new houses. Due to the fact that these resources are expensive and may be limited, we are tasked with developing an effective way of utilising these resources efficiently by connecting them to each house within the housing scheme.

Tasked to develop an algorithm that will allow the utility companies to use the least amount of resources to connect each house in the new housing scheme. Therefore, the utility company will be able to work out the distance between each house where a connecting path is possible. The user will also be able to effectively use their resources as the program will take the input (the different houses and number of houses) and identify the shortest path and cost, depending on the distance between each house.  

Utilized Kruskal's MST
